The concept of the publication was working towards creating the most careful process, learning from and being inspired by publishing projects from all over the world. A shared care for our limits, our collective ideals, and the more-than-human world found expression in a code of practice, regularly revisited and refined. Each work was manually adjusted according to the author’s wishes, carefully designed and shared transparently.

All materials were chosen for their adherence to our understanding of care: the format to create as little offcut as possible, the colours to use the least ink, and the fonts for the political ideals of the collectives that drew them. Involvements in the design process were relinquished back to the authors in collaborative sessions: for instance, each author hand-drew the title for their piece, and the sleeve paper was collectively made of our test-prints and prototypes. The books were printed by April & Tochter, who specialise in ecological production, additions were self-printed on a solar-powered matrix printer and a riso printer. The cover of the books shows an infinite map that works as a second index, highlighting connections and relations between the contributions.

The works are sorted in chapters, threading together carefully crafted stories through the themes growing, collecting, communing, resisting, holding, softening and weaving. Each chapter has its own symbol, allowing texts to be connected to multiple chapter threads. The linearity is additionally broken up by links between works in the sidenotes suggesting other works considering connected thoughts.
