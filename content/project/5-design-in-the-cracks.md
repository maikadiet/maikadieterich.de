The concept of the publication was an attempt to create the most careful process possible, learning from and being inspired by publishing projects from all over the world. All materials were chosen for their adherence to our understanding of care: the format to create as little offcut as possible, the colours to use the least ink, and the fonts for the political ideals of the collectives that drew them. 

Control over the design process were relinquished back to the authors in collaborative sessions: for instance, each author hand-drew the title for their piece, and the sleeve paper was collectively made of our test-prints and prototypes. The cover of the books shows an infinite map that works as a second index, highlighting connections and relations between the contributions.

The works are sorted in chapters, threading together carefully crafted stories through the themes growing, collecting, communing, resisting, holding, softening and weaving. Each chapter has its own symbol, allowing texts to be connected to multiple chapter threads. The linearity is additionally broken up by links between works in the sidenotes suggesting other works considering connected thoughts.

Editorial and Organisation by Elena Blumenbach, Helena Dietz-Rötlingshofer, Barbara Macza and Lea Eon.
