This work is an experiment on finding a visual form for the aesthetics of language. Grammatical values from seven different languages are read by the programme and used to determine the look and behaviour of each animation. Unique visuals are created each time the programme is run.

Direction of writing, number of characters in the alphabet and tenses determine the behaviour, look and number of generated particles. With the digits on the keyboard you can switch between seven different languages. The program loads the corresponding values  and generates the animation.

The work was exhibited as part of the Still Here exhibition by PÄŤ & PÓL and as part of the exhibition of the Bratislava Design Week in Winter 2022 in Bratislava, Slovakia.
