The Un/learn AI publication series consists of three parts:
Approaching, Navigating and Integrating AI in Aesthetic Practices, which provides insights into the four-year research project KITeGG. The three books contain articles by KITeGG researchers and visiting lecturers, student projects, as well as materials from the Summer and Winter Schools.
Each book highlights a phase of the research project and is curated around different focus topics.

The publications are available as limited-edition prints or as PDF downloads on our website. Here, you can also browse articles by topic or language, and explore non-printed content such as additional translations and videos.
Built as a web-to-print publication, the pipeline contains multiple Natural-Language-Processing algorithms that contribute to the books' navigation system as well as to the visual and structural design. For instance, the texts across all three books have been chunked and semantically compared.
If a chunk has a high semantic similarity to another chunk in one of the three books, you can click on the link and read through the book "horizontally". You can also download or print your chunk chains as custom PDFs.

I designed the website to show all three books in one place, mirroring the horizontal folding of the chunk stream in the dashboard design.
