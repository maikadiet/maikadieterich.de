Limbus is a multi dimensional browser or cardboard vr experience that hypothesises about the possible outcomes of implementing Artificial Intelligence in our society. How can humans and technology coexist? What could a best- or a worst-case scenario look like?
We want to invite you to not only think about our future in regards to the usage of modern technology, but also reflect on our relationship to technological progress so far. Enjoy!
