The Un/learn AI publication series consists of three parts:
Approaching, Navigating and Integrating AI in Aesthetic Practices, which provides insights into the four-year research project KITeGG. The three books contain articles by KITeGG researchers and visiting lecturers, student projects, as well as materials from the Summer and Winter Schools.
Each book highlights a phase of the research project and is curated around different focus topics.

The publications are available as limited-edition prints or as PDF downloads on our website. 
Built as a web-to-print publication, the pipeline contains multiple Natural-Language-Processing algorithms that contribute to the books' navigation system as well as to the visual and structural design. For instance, the texts across all three books have been chunked and semantically compared.
If a chunk has a high semantic similarity to another chunk  in one the books, that chunk is given as a chunk reference in the margin.

Lars Hembacher and Paul Eßer designed the basic layout of the three books and setup the printing pipeline. Francesco Scheffczyk and I took over to finish the pipeline and layout of the three books and the website.
