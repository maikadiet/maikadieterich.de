DesignUp was a team of around 50 German and Senegalese Designers consisiting of mostly artists, product/fashion/industrial designers and artisans. We started working together digitally in 2021, focusing on upcycling. In May 2022 we got together in Dakar. The works were exhibited from the 24th – 29th of May in the “Super Mbalit Festival” as part of the Dak’Art Biennale Off programme.

I worked with Papis Diop (artist and product designer). We designed two variations of screwless connections by modelling plastic bottles with heat, which we showcased in a coat hanger/sculpture. Together with Martin Bassène (specialised in metal work), I also designed a lamp out of different leftover materials.

Papis Diop and Sabine Boger and I also gave a workshop during the festival, in which we used various rubbish materials to make paintbrushes with children of Yarrakh (the part of Dakar in which we had out exhibition).
