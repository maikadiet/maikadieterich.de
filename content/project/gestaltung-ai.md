Gestaltung.ai is the website of the KITeGG research project in which I am involved. KITeGG is a joint project of five universities on the integration of AI in design education. The project partners are the Mainz University of Applied Sciences, the Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach, the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd, the Cologne International School of Design and the Fachhochschule Trier.

The design of the website is based on the great corporate identity created for KITeGG by Laura Hilbert. We used the boxes from the CI. When a box is selected, it resizes and grows to present it's content.
