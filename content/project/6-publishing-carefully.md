Publishing Carefully was our text contribution to the first Transversal Design publication. It describes the design and production process of the book and is itself printed on an old matrix printer from 1986, which we bought second-hand in Freiburg and transported back to Basel by bike.

The printing of the 300 texts was done in an open session, using a solar panel to print outside when the weather allowed. The session took about 30 hours, using two colour bands and old tractor paper.
