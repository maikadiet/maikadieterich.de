The Stack Report is a publication covering stories in the Tezos ecosystem through blockchain data visualisations. It transforms the data streams coming from the Tezos stack of digital, social and physical layers of this new decentralised world into data-driven weekly recaps, monthly deep dives and long-form stories into specific themes and topics.

I was part of the Stack Report team in the summer of 2022, contributing two deep-dive articles on different aspects of NFT Art.
