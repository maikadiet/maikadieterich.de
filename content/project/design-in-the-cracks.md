“As designers, we must ask ourselves how we are designing in times of polycrisis” is a constant question in our transversal design community and in the making of this publication. The book brings together 46 contributions, describing personal transversal design practices, showcasing radical counterproposals, tools for solidarity, and speculative models towards positive change. At its core, the answer is care — for boundaries, collective ideals, and the more-than-human world, through which we explore how to shape and be shaped by our communities and ecologies. 

The concept of the publication was working towards creating the most careful process, learning from and being inspired by publishing projects from all over the world. A shared care for our limits, our collective ideals, and the more-than-human world found expression in a code of practice, regularly revisited and refined. Each work was manually adjusted according to the author’s wishes, carefully designed and shared transparently.
All materials were chosen for their adherence to our understanding of care: the format to create as little offcut as possible, the colours to use the least ink, and the fonts for the political ideals of the collectives that drew them. Involvements in the design process were relinquished back to the authors in collaborative sessions: for instance, each author hand-drew the title for their piece, and the sleeve paper was collectively made of our test-prints and prototypes. The books were printed by April & Tochter, who specialise in ecological production, additions were self-printed on a solar-powered matrix printer and a riso printer. The cover of the books shows an infinite map that works as a second index, highlighting connections and relations between the contributions.
