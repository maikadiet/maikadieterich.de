“As designers, we must ask ourselves how we are designing in times of polycrisis” is part of our introduction and strongly guided us in making “Design in the Cracks – Transversal Design Publication Vol.1”. Authored by students, researchers, professors, and associated practitioners who came together under the notion of Transversal Design – an emerging field of thinking and making together towards more liveable futures. While it is a master programme as well as a set of practices and ideals that is closely connected to the Critical Media Lab at the Basel Academy of Art and Design FHNW.

The process was shaped and guided by seven students and contains more than 40 contributions from the community, describing personal transversal design practices, showcasing radical counterproposals, tools for solidarity, or speculative models towards positive change. The pieces range between collages, poems, academic writing, audio recording, and storyboards and were lovingly peer-reviewed twice by community member tandems.

The concept of the publication was working towards creating the most careful process, learning from and being inspired by publishing projects from all over the world. A shared care for our limits, our collective ideals, and the more-than-human world found expression in a code of practice, regularly revisited and refined. Each work was manually adjusted according to the author’s wishes, carefully designed and shared transparently.

All materials were chosen for their adherence to our understanding of care: the format to create as little offcut as possible, the colours to use the least ink, and the fonts for the political ideals of the collectives that drew them. Involvements in the design process were relinquished back to the authors in collaborative sessions: for instance, each author hand-drew the title for their piece, and the sleeve paper was collectively made of our test-prints and prototypes. The books were printed by April & Tochter, who specialise in ecological production, additions were self-printed on a solar-powered matrix printer and a riso printer. The cover of the books shows an infinite map that works as a second index, highlighting connections and relations between the contributions.

The works are sorted in chapters, weaving careful crafted stories through the themes growing, collecting, communing, resisting, holding, softening and weaving. Each chapter has its own symbol, allowing texts to be connected to multiple chapter threads. The linearity is additionally broken up by links between works in the sidenotes suggesting other works considering connected thoughts. Breaking this linearity visualizes the overlapping network of rich thoughts the community contains and opens diverse perspectives.

This publication does not aim to impress or inspire purchase through its design. The dissemination of the books is a gifting from hand-to-hand and wants to share with and invite creatives into our community. It is an inquiry into making together where group consensus, collaboration and ideals shape a process that is at the centre of our thinking. We, as part of the community warmly invite you to explore and think with us.
