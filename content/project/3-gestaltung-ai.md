Gestaltung.ai is the website of the KITeGG research project in which I am involved. KITeGG is a joint project of five universities on the integration of AI in design education. The project partners are the Mainz University of Applied Sciences, the Hochschule für Gestaltung Offenbach, the Hochschule für Gestaltung Schwäbisch Gmünd, the Cologne International School of Design and the Fachhochschule Trier.

The design of the website incorporates the font and colourful layers of the corporate identity created for KITeGG by Laura Hilbert. When a box is selected, it resizes and grows to present its content, the gradient button can be clicked to bring the colourful layers back into the website.
