Hyperobject is a term for complex systems such as climate change or the internet. Entities that extend massively across space and time, so that we humans cannot perceive them, but can only recognise them through data collection and evaluation. With digitalisation progressing worldwide, the amount of data we can collect and analyse grows. This in turn means that more and more complex hyperobjects are being discovered. Thus, the question of how hyperobjects can be communicated properly, once again allowing sensory and emotional engagement becomes more and more relevant.

The topic is presented in the form of a virtual reality application, as well as a reader and an installation space that translates the navigational elements of the virtual environment into the physical environment. In the virtual world, you can enter six different chapters, which explain different aspects of the topic in the form of spoken texts. In addition, one sees animations that visually support the auditive input.
