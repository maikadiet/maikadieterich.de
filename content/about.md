Nice to meet you 💓 

My name is Maika, I am a designer based in Basel.
This winter I will be busy writing my MA thesis in Transversal Design at the HGK in Basel and working on interfaces and publications around AI in Design and Art Education for KITeGG (gestaltung.ai).

I am currently fascinated by all things infrastructure, alternative low-tech practices and 👩‍💻🌱🪄.  I am always happy to hear from you ✉️
